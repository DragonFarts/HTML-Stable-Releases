Canvas Drawing
This is a simple web-based application that allows users to create shapes on an HTML5 canvas using various parameters. The application offers a user-friendly interface that enables users to select and customise different shapes and add them to the canvas.
The following shapes are available in the application:
Square
Triangle
Circle
Hexagon
Cube
Triangular Prism


How to use:
1. Select a shape from the "Presets" drop-down menu. This will load the preset values for the selected shape into the input fields.
2. If you want to customize the shape, adjust the input fields according to your needs.
3. Click the "Draw" button to draw the shape on the canvas.
4. You can add additional rows to input custom values for a shape by clicking the "Add Row" button.
5. If you want to draw multiple instances of a shape, you can use the "Add Here Rows" or "Add Preset Rows" buttons.
6. The "Add Here Rows" button allows you to specify a comma-separated list of row numbers to duplicate.
7. The "Add Preset Rows" button duplicates the entire set of rows for the selected shape.
8. To clear the canvas, click the "Clear Canvas" button.





Shape parameters:


Each shape has different parameters that can be adjusted to customize the appearance of the shape. The following are the input fields and their meanings:
DP: Dot pitch, the distance between dots in the shape (in pixels).
DP Add: The amount to add to the dot pitch for each row (in pixels).
M: The width of the shape (in pixels).
R: The radius of the shape (in pixels).
A2M: The amount to add to the width for each row (in pixels).
A2R: The amount to add to the radius for each row (in pixels).
Rep: The number of times to repeat the shape.
MS: The amount to scale the shape by.
Use: A checkbox that determines whether to use the specified value for the X, Y, or R parameter.
X: The X coordinate of the shape (in pixels).
Y: The Y coordinate of the shape (in pixels).
R: The rotation angle of the shape (in degrees).
Color: The color of the shape (in hexadecimal).
Cube and Triangular Prism:
The Cube and Triangular Prism shapes are composed of multiple squares and triangles, respectively. The input fields for these shapes are organized into rows, where each row corresponds to a square or triangle. The parameters for each row are the same as those for the Square and Triangle shapes, except for the "Rep" parameter, which specifies the number of times to repeat the row.
Presets:
The application comes with preset values for each of the shapes, which can be selected from the "Presets" drop-down menu. The presets are defined as arrays of values for each input field. To add a new preset or modify an existing one, you can edit the "presets" object in the JavaScript code. Each preset is identified by a unique ID (e.g., "001" for the Square preset), which is used to retrieve the preset values when selected from the drop-down menu.
Overall, Canvas Drawing is a versatile tool that allows users to create custom shapes on an HTML5 canvas. With a wide range of parameters and presets to choose from, the application is suitable for both beginners and advanced users who want to experiment with different shapes and designs.
